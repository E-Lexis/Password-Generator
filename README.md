# Module 3: Challenge 3: Password Generator

This week's challenge consists of refractoring some javascript by creating a function that generates a password based on the user's chosen criteria. The requirements that this function had to satisfy is as follows:

## Acceptance Criteria

* GIVEN I need a new, secure password
* WHEN I click the button to generate a password
* THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
* WHEN prompted for password criteria
* THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
* WHEN prompted for the length of the password
* THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
* WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
* THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
* WHEN I answer each prompt
* THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
* WHEN all prompts are answered
* THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
* WHEN the password is generated
* THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
